with st.expander("‚ÑπÔ∏è How This App Works"):
    st.markdown("""
This prediction tool uses a machine learning model to determine whether someone is **likely** or **unlikely** to seek mental health treatment.

### üîç Here's how it works:
1. **You fill in the form** with details like your age, work setup, access to mental health support, and comfort discussing issues.
2. The app prepares your input by converting your responses into numerical values (since the model only understands numbers).
3. It then passes this information to a trained **Random Forest Classifier**, which was built using real survey data from people working in the tech industry.
4. The model looks for patterns and makes a prediction:
   - **üîµ Likely** to seek mental health treatment
   - **üü¢ Unlikely** to seek treatment

> This is only a predictive tool and should not replace professional advice. Always seek proper help if you‚Äôre struggling.

# Section: About the data
with st.expander("üìä About the Data Source"):
    st.markdown("""
This app is powered by data from the **Mental Health in Tech Survey**, conducted by [OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness)](https://osmihelp.org/).

The dataset was collected from professionals working in the tech industry and includes responses related to:
- Personal mental health history
- Work environment and company size
- Access to mental health resources
- Comfort discussing mental health issues
